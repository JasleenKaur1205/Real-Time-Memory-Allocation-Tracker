# Real-Time-Memory-Allocation-Tracker
# Adaptive Resource Allocation System

An adaptive resource allocation system for multiprogramming environments that dynamically adjusts CPU, memory, and other system resources among concurrently running programs. This project improves system performance by preventing bottlenecks and ensuring efficient utilization of resources with a real-time feedback loop.

## Overview

This project is designed to:
- *Dynamically adjust resource distribution* (CPU, memory, etc.) among multiple running programs.
- *Optimize system performance* by preventing resource bottlenecks.
- *Provide a real-time feedback loop* through continuous monitoring and automated decision making.

The system consists of three main modules:
1. *System Monitoring & Data Acquisition:* Continuously collects system performance data.
2. *Adaptive Allocation Engine:* Analyzes collected data and makes decisions to adjust resource allocation.
3. *Visualization & Control Interface:* Displays real-time performance metrics and allows manual control.

## Features

- *Real-Time Monitoring:* Collects CPU, memory, disk, and network statistics.
- *Adaptive Decision Making:* Uses rule-based heuristics (and potentially machine learning in the future) to reallocate resources.
- *Interactive Dashboard:* Provides real-time graphs and charts with controls for manual adjustments.
- *Feedback Loop:* Continuously refines allocation decisions based on system performance.

## Module Breakdown

### 1. System Monitoring & Data Acquisition
- *Purpose:* Collect raw performance metrics (e.g., CPU load, memory usage, I/O statistics, per-process details).
- *Key Points:*
  - Continuous monitoring at configurable intervals (e.g., every 1â€“5 seconds).
  - Low overhead to avoid affecting system performance.
  - Outputs structured data (e.g., JSON) for use by other modules.

### 2. Adaptive Allocation Engine (Decision-Making)
- *Purpose:* Analyze aggregated data and decide how to adjust resource allocation.
- *Key Points:*
  - Uses simple rule-based heuristics (e.g., if CPU > 80%, reduce non-critical tasks).
  - Optionally extendable to use machine learning for predictive adjustments.
  - Prioritizes processes and generates adjustment actions.
  - Incorporates a feedback loop to learn from previous actions.

### 3. Visualization & Control Interface
- *Purpose:* Display current performance metrics and allow manual adjustments.
- *Key Points:*
  - Real-time graphs and charts (CPU, memory, I/O).
  - Interactive controls for threshold adjustments and manual overrides.
  - A user-friendly dashboard that offers an at-a-glance system status.

## Technology Stack

- *Programming Language:* Python (for rapid development and ease of integration)
- *Libraries & Tools:*
  - *psutil:* System monitoring and data acquisition.
  - *json:* Data serialization.
  - *Flask/Dash:* Building the web-based dashboard.
  - *Asyncio or schedule:* Running periodic tasks.
  - *scikit-learn/TensorFlow (optional):* For future machine learning enhancements.
  - *Linux cgroups:* (Optional) For enforcing resource limits in a production environment.
